# EmailAccounts
Email account creater program that replicates OSU's system

Email should be formatted as "name.N@osu.edu" where N is a positive integer to ensure students with the same last name have unique 
email addresses.

If an email account is to be created with a last name that is already in the system, N is simply increased by one.

This was a project to practice creating and implementing interfaces in Java.
